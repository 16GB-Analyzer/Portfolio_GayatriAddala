# Portfolio_GayatriAddala


# 👋 Hi there, welcome to my corner of GitHub!

Thanks for stopping by!  
I’m **Gayatri Bhavana Addala**, currently working as a **Research Assistant in Machine Learning** while finishing my Master’s in Computer Science at VCU.

### 🚀 Quick intro
- 🧠 I tinker with models across **cybersecurity, energy, and neuroscience**.  
- 🔬 My projects range from **GANs for intrusion detection** to **CNN-LSTM for forecasting** to **self-supervised video analysis**.  
- 📊 But here’s the fun part: at the end of the day, it’s always just **data in → model out**… the domain never scares me, because the core challenge is *teaching machines to learn*.

### ✨ What you’ll find here
This repository is my **portfolio site**, where I showcase:
- My latest projects & research updates  
- Experiments in AI/ML across multiple domains  
- A little personality woven into the code 😉

💡 *If you’re curious, think of me as someone who speaks many “domain languages,” but all conversations eventually circle back to my favorite duo: **data & models***.
